description "Go is a programming language developed by Google. It's designed \
for simplicity, efficiency, and strong support for concurrent programming, \
making it ideal for building scalable and high performance applications. \
Go features a statically typed syntax, garbage collection, and a rich \
standard library, which together facilitate rapid development and ease of \
maintenance."
